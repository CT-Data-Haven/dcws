\describe{
\item{\code{year}}{Numeric, year of survey}
\item{\code{code}}{Character, question code}
\item{\code{question}}{Character, full text of survey question}
\item{\code{responses}}{List of character vectors, of all possible responses for each question}
}
}

Compiled DCWS crosstabs

\usage{
cws_codebook
}
\description{
This is a data frame of all the codes and questions, and corresponding possible responses, for each year of the survey. Previously this was part of the \code{cws_full_data} data frame, but is now split out on its own to reduce redundancy and save space. Note that surveys are identified only by year, not span; pooled data use codes following their endyears.
