Defusing enquo() enquos() needed complex cases, instance need inspect modify expressions way. .data pronoun object represents current slice data. variable name string, use .data pronoun subset variable [[. Another tidy eval operator :=. makes possible use glue curly-curly syntax LHS =. technical reasons, R language support complex expressions left =, use := workaround. Many tidy eval functions like dplyr::mutate() dplyr::summarise() give automatic name unnamed inputs. need create sort automatic names , use as_label(). instance, glue-tunnelling syntax can reproduced manually : Expressions defused enquo() (tunnelled {{) need simple column names, can arbitrarily complex. as_label() handles cases gracefully. code assumes simple column name, use as_name() instead. safer throws error input name expected.","code":"my_function <- function(data, var, ...) {   data %>%     group_by(...) %>%     summarise(mean = mean({{ var }})) } my_function <- function(data, var, ...) {   # Defuse   var <- enquo(var)   dots <- enquos(...)    # Inject   data %>%     group_by(!!!dots) %>%     summarise(mean = mean(!!var)) } my_var <- \"disp\" mtcars %>% summarise(mean = mean(.data[[my_var]])) my_function <- function(data, var, suffix = \"foo\") {   # Use `{{` to tunnel function arguments and the usual glue   # operator `{` to interpolate plain strings.   data %>%     summarise(\"{{ var }}_mean_{suffix}\" := mean({{ var }})) } my_function <- function(data, var, suffix = \"foo\") {   var <- enquo(var)   prefix <- as_label(var)   data %>%     summarise(\"{prefix}_mean_{suffix}\" := mean(!!var)) }"},{"path":"https://ct-data-haven.github.io/dcws/news/index.html","id":"dcws-0009000","dir":"Changelog","previous_headings":"","what":"dcws 0.0.0.9000","title":"dcws 0.0.0.9000","text":"Added NEWS.md file track changes package.","code":""}]
